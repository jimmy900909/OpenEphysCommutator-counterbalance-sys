This is a wireless counterbalance system that can adjust the length of the cable automatically for OpenEphys commutator while conducting freely moving animal experiment  

#closed-loop Automatic Counterbalance animal experiment system 

#tension-free and biting-prevention for cable in the freely moving animal experiment

The toggling and dragging can seriously cause the artifacts to signal when doing a cable-connected behavior experiment on an awake and freely-moving animal. The automatic rotation commutator is widely used in labs and commercialized, however, to adjust the length of the cable is always depends on manual holding or passive counterbalance sys. As the hanged part would be bited by animal and the tension can constraint the movement, a active counterbalance system is needed for such animal experiment.
